# Arc-for-Discord

Arc for Discord is a custom css file that integrates Discord's UI with [Arc,](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme) a popular theme for Linux.

## Install

Discord doesn't currently natively support custom css, but it's possible to inject custom stylesheets using third party tools such as [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) and [BetterDiscord.](https://github.com/jiiks/betterdiscordapp) If you'd like to use Arc for Discord, you'll need to install one of those tools first.

I personally used BeautifulDiscord while making this skin.

1. Install BeautifulDiscord.
2. Copy the css from arc.css into the custom css file that BeautifulDiscord generates.
