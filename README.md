# Note:

I'm presently in the middle of completely rewriting this skin to make sure it's completely compatible with recent versions of Discord (stable). Right now it's still pretty broken but it should be pretty useable if you set Discord to use the dark theme.

# Arc-for-Discord

Arc for Discord is a custom css file that integrates Discord's UI with [Arc,](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme) a popular theme for Linux.

## Features:

- use Arc's scrollbars
- use Arc's sidebar color even on light theme
- flatter and more compact ui
- less cluttered chat
- add a colon after usernames in chat
- remove @ before username in dm header
- always display timestamps on all messages

## Install

Discord doesn't currently natively support custom css, but it's possible to inject custom stylesheets using third party tools such as [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) and [BetterDiscord.](https://github.com/jiiks/betterdiscordapp) If you'd like to use Arc for Discord, you'll need to install one of those tools first.

I personally used BeautifulDiscord while making this skin, and it may not work with all of BetterDiscord's features.

1. Install BeautifulDiscord.
2. Copy the css from arc.css into the custom css file that BeautifulDiscord generates.
