# Arc-for-Discord

Arc for Discord is a custom css file that integrates Discord's UI with [Arc,](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme) a wildly popular theme for Linux.

## Installation

Discord doesn't currently natively support custom css, but it's possible to inject custom stylesheets using third party tools such as [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) and [BetterDiscord.](https://github.com/jiiks/betterdiscordapp) If you'd like to use Arc for Discord, you'll also need to install one of those tools first.

I used BeautifulDiscord to write this css, and I'm unfamiliar with BetterDiscord, so these installation instructions will be for BeautifulDiscord.

1. Install [BeautifulDiscord.](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord)
2. Launch BeautifulDiscord.
3. Put `discord-custom.css` in `/discord/resources`
